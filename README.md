# This system creates  a platform where lecturers would upload assignments and exercises so that students would download them, solve them and submit them.

# Both lecturers and students alike are expected to create accounts first before they are granted access to the system.

# In the system we have lecturers and students sections which are directed by the lecturer and student buttons on the landing page through the login or signup pages.

# A database is created which handles all the above activities. 

# Languages or tools used are **php**, **html**, **css**, **javascript**, **jquery**, **bootstrap**, **mysql**.
